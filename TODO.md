# TODO

- [x] vite build setup (currently we're just running vite dev server for serving js)
- [x] Update or replace vite-fastapi. It probably doesn't even need to be linked with fastapi. Just some jinja2 template tags etc and reading manifest.json might be fine.

- [x] Node color should be fetched from _meta
- [x] Node editor should use the updated node format with nested _meta
- [x] Node meta/display information to use node type as default
- [x] Fix edit/update mode with node editor
- [x] Generic CRUD API for arango models
  - [x] Node types api and use it
- [x] Fields addition to add node/edge when selecting a node type
- [x] Test standalone v-network-graph to see if icon and images work and it's an issue with my code.
  - [x] Test using a test view.

- [x] Icon support for nodes
- [x] Image support for nodes
- [x] Line color support for edges
- [x] Save extra info as `extra_info` instead of `extraInfo` in the db and update code accordingly.
- [x] Node details page (separate window) should show more node details
  - [x] Item query API
  - [x] Detail page can work with node key too instead of just inter-window communication
  - [ ] and configurable "n" linkages ( by default expand by 1 - immediate links)
- [x] Node data display reusable component for GDEDetail and other places.
  - [x] Option to display links
  - [x] Link direction indicator and textual description (bajwa initiated rco)
  - [ ] Option to "expand" (get links and display them)
- [x] State management via Pinia and use it for storing node types information.
- [ ] When updating nodes/edges don't set derived/calculated fields. Like label if it's not present and is fetched from node_type etc then on update it should not be set as a value on the node unless the user actually sets it.
- [x] Bug: Nodes without any node type don't have a fill color in graph display.
- [ ] Bug: Newly created edges are not editable (error says missing _meta field) until they are saved and loaded back from DB.
- [ ] Bug: Newly created nodes don't show node key as label if no node label was provided.
- [ ] Bug: Newly created nodes don't display node color according to type (because that is fetched from the DB and theses nodes have not yet been saved).
- [ ] Bug: Editing a node only displays key, type and extra info. No other field is displayed.
- [ ] Start implementing RCO graph.
- [ ] Bug: Node meta doesn't take affect for newly created/edited nodes. Only works when loaded from DB.
- [ ] Node types management interface
- [x] Export graph as SVG
- [ ] Export and Import Graph (dumps and loads as JSON)
- [ ] Ability to use external sources (databases) for graph data.
  - [ ] Layout and display config stays in GDE database but actual data is fetched from external data source.
  - [ ] Initially can support arango and relational (PostgreSQL, etc) data sources.
  - [ ] Will probably need to implement database adapters for fetching data
    - [ ] Get linked data
    - [ ] Ability to expand a record (fetch linked records)
- [x] Typescript support
- [ ] Content type display components (image, location/map, event, etc)
