# TODO

- [x] vite build setup (currently we're just running vite dev server for serving js)
- [x] Update or replace vite-fastapi. It probably doesn't even need to be linked with fastapi. Just some jinja2 template tags etc and reading manifest.json might be fine.

- [x] Node color should be fetched from _meta
- [x] Node editor should use the updated node format with nested _meta
